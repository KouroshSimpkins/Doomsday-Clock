# Doomsday Clock

This is the repository for my final submission for the Physical Computing module at the University of the Arts London's Creative Computing Institute.

## What the f*&$ is the Doomsday Clock?

The doomsday clock is a metaphorical clock created by the bulletin of the atomic scientists, which is generally said to represent the scientific communities displeasure at the state of current global affairs. It is not meant to be a prediction, but rather a reminder of the current state of the world.

My idea was to create a physical model of the doomsday clock, that ran through a dataset of the times that it has been set to in the past, and presented this on an analogue clock face. It is powered by an arduino UNO, and takes a dataset on an SD card, before writing the year on a 7 segment display and the angle of the time to a servo motor.

To keep the process of creating this piece as simple as possible, I decided to avoid having a moving hour hand. Instead opting for a stationary hour hand and a minute hand that moved. This is because the hour hand on the doomsday clock hasn't moved, as we have always been on the verge of doomsday in the eyes of the bulletin.

## My Final Product

The final piece has resulted in a relatively simple clock, that follows the same design cues as the original doomsday clock.
